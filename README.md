# CommonWeathBank-Internship
**BACKGROUND**

BA is embarking on a long-term vision with trusted partner InsightSpark, a data science specialist.

This vision is focused around using the huge volumes of CBA’s transactional data, open-source data, and advanced data science to build a platform that will provide insights for businesses, governments, and investors in Australia.

The data engineering team is responsible for building data engineering pipelines, running analysis on big data, and deploying algorithms into production at scale. This project’s success lies heavily on the data engineering team.

**TASK 1: Data Aggregation and Analysis**

Create a data engineering pipeline to aggregate and extract insights from a data set:
- Analyze the "CSV Data Set" of supermarket transactions to address key questions:
+ Across locations, how many apples were purchased in cash?
+ How much total cash was spent on these apples?
+ Across all payment methods, how much money was spent at the Bakershire store location by non-member customers?"

**TASK 2: Data Anonymisation**

**Background**: For CBA and InsightSpark to continue with the data science vision, the data scientists at InsightSpark need to combine customer data with the transactional data from the supermarkets.

The customer data will come from the CBA mobile app. However, we cannot provide them with the raw data until it has been suitably anonymised to protect the identity of individuals in the data set.

**Tasks**
+ Anonymise this data to hide personal details while preserving any useful information for the data scientists at InsightSpark.

**TASK 3: Propose Data Analysis Approaches**
- Explore @CommBank Twitter account.
- Examine the Twitter API's data dictionary.
- Create a proposal outlining insights from @CommBank Twitter data for InsightSpark.

**TASK 4: Designing a Database**
  Design the structure of information in a database:
- Propose a structured database for storing tweets from the CommBank Twitter account, replies, quote retweets, and direct mentions.
